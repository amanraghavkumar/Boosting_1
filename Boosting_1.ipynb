    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (simple models) to create a strong learner (a more accurate and robust model). The idea behind boosting is to sequentially train weak models on different subsets of the training data, giving more emphasis to the misclassified instances in each iteration. This helps to improve the overall predictive performance."
